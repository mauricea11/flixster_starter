### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Add your response here

Yes, they did, particularly when it came to using CSS to build the layout of my website. Before attending the CSS lecture, I 
thought the language was a hastle to use. I was annoyed by the seemingly random nature of CSS where if you want to position an element for example you have to consider whether it's block or inline, then from there if margin can be applied or text align - but if that element is in a container will the margin inherit the parent? This was very frustrating for me as someone who comes from back-end development. But it was the Flexbox Froggy game that was referred to by the instructors that really solidified my knowledge in an easier way to lay out elements: flexbox. Now I find positioning elements much easier and fun.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

If I had more time, I would have included a hover over modal effect similar to Netflix's video preview on the homepage.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Add your response here

I believe I highlighted the general function of all of the core features in my code. I didn't plan for the demo to not be as pressured as I thought. Everyone was nice and it didn't seem like I was being criticized.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

I would like to shout out Anitya for constantly encouraging us to try our best and to not feel like we're being pressured. It was helpful, thank you!
